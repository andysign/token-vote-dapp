# Template for NextJS environment variables.

# If not set, we provide default values (check `scaffold.config.ts`) so developers can start prototyping out of the box

# To access the values stored in this env file you can use: process.env.VARIABLENAME
# You'll need to prefix the variables names with NEXT_PUBLIC_ if you want to access them on the client side.
